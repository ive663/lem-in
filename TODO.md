TODO list

To-Do List for Project "lem-in" - Digital Ant Farm:

1. File Input Parsing:
[✓] - Read and parse the input file.  
[✓] - Handle comments and unknown commands appropriately.  
[✓] - Validate the input data format.  
[✓] - Identify the start and end rooms.  

2. Create Ant Farm:
[✓] - Represent the ant farm with rooms and tunnels.
[✓] - Define a data structure for rooms (name, coordinates).
[✓] - Define a data structure for tunnels (links between rooms).
[✓] - Ensure each room contains valid information.

3. Path Finding:
[✓] - Implement an algorithm to find the quickest path from ##start to ##end.
[✓] - Consider scenarios with no valid path.
[✓] - Optimize for both shortest and simplest paths.

4. Output Format:
[] - Display the number of ants.
[] - Output the rooms with their coordinates.
[] - Output the links between rooms.
[] - Ensure the format matches the specified requirements.

5. Move Ants:
[] - Simulate the movement of ants through the tunnels.
[] - Update the state of the ant farm after each move.
[] - Avoid traffic jams and ensure ants take the shortest path.

6. Handle Errors:
[✓] - Implement error handling for various scenarios (e.g., invalid data, no start/end room,duplicated rooms, etc.).
[✓] - Provide informative error messages.

7. Go Language Implementation:
[✓] - Write the entire project in Go.
[✓] - Follow best practices for Go programming.
[✓] - Use appropriate Go libraries for file handling and data structures.

8. Unit Testing:
[x] - Create test files to cover different scenarios.
[x] - Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual functions.

9. Documentation:
[✓] - Document the code thoroughly, including function and package-level comments.
[✓] - Provide a README with instructions on how to build, run, and test the program.

10. Project Structure:
[✓] - Organize the project into modular and well-structured components.
[✓] - Separate concerns (e.g., input parsing, path finding, output generation).

11. Graceful Termination:
[✓] - Ensure the program exits gracefully without unexpected crashes.
[✓] - Handle interrupts and unexpected termination scenarios.

12. Optimization:
[✓] - Optimize the code for performance where applicable.
[✓] - Consider efficiency in path finding algorithms.

13. Code Review:
[✓] - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure adherence to coding standards.
[✓] - Address any identified issues or improvements.

14. Final Testing:
[✓] - Perform comprehensive testing of the entire system.
[✓] - Validate the program against edge cases and boundary scenarios.

15. Submission:
[] - Prepare the final version for submission.
[] - Include necessary documentation and files.

Note: This to-do list is a guideline, and tasks can be adapted based on project progress and specific implementation details. Regular updates and testing are crucial throughout the development process.
